# EQ - Embedded Queueing

EQ is a little framework to queue tasks within a process.

## Installation

Install it yourself using Rubygems.

    $ gem install eq

Or use something like [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).

## Example

If you want to execute a simple example you can just run [examples/simple_usage.rb](./examples/simple_usage.rb) from your commandline.

**1. Define a Job class with a perform method.**

	class MyJob
	  def self.perform *some_args
	    # do some long running stuff here
	  end
	end

**2. Start the EQ system.**

	EQ.boot
	
**3. Let EQ do some work you.**

	EQ.queue.push MyJob, 'foo'
	EQ.queue.push MyJob, 'bar'
	â€¦	

## Configuration

Right now there is only one queueing backend available that is based on the Sequel gem. Therefore, basically any SQL database supported by Sequel might be used.

The default SQL database that is used is a . You can change it using any argument that Sequel.connect method would accept.
	
	# SQLite3 in-memory (default) using String syntax
	EQ.config.sequel = 'sqlite:/'
	
	# SQLite3 file using Hash syntax
	EQ.config.sequel = {adapter: 'sqlite', database: 'my_db.sqlite3'}
	
	# Postgres
	EQ.config.sequel = 'postgres://user:password@host:port/my_db'
	

### Logging

EQ uses the logging mechanism of the underlying Celluloid (`Celluloid.logger`) framework. Basically you can just bind it to your application logger or re-configure it (see the Documentation of the `Logger` class from Ruby Standard Library).

**Changing the Logger:**

	# Use the logger of your Rails application.
	Celluloid.logger = Rails.logger
	
	# No more logging at all.
	Celluloid.logger = Logger.new('/dev/null')
