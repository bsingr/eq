# EXPERIMENTAL FOO, THE DEVILS RIDE...

# EQ - Embedded Queueing

EQ is a little framework to queue and perform background tasks within a single-process ruby application. It uses the Celluloid actor framework to do the work in the background. Its queue backends persist your jobs. So your jobs will survive application stop/restart.

## Installation

Install it yourself using Rubygems.

    $ gem install eq

Or use something like [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).

## Example

If you want to execute a simple example you can just run [examples/simple_usage.rb](./examples/simple_usage.rb) from your commandline.

**1. Define a Job class with a perform method.**

	class MyJob
	  def self.perform *some_args
	    # do some long running stuff here
	  end
	end

**2. Start the EQ system.**

	EQ.boot
	
**3. Enqueue some jobs in the EQ queue.**

	EQ.push MyJob, 'foo'
	EQ.push MyJob, 'bar'
	â€¦	

**5. Let EQ do your work.**

	# EQ will spawn and maintain worker threads that execute the following for you:
	MyJob.perform 'foo'
	MyJob.perform 'bar'

**6. Shutdown EQ gracefully when you're application is done.***

	EQ.shutdown

## Configuration

Right now there are two queueing backends available, one that is based on the Sequel gem and one based on LevelDB. With Sequel basically any SQL database might be used. Just make sure that you install the Backend before running the application.

### Sequel

Gemfile

	gem 'sequel'
	gem 'sqlite3'

Configuration

	EQ.config.queue = 'sequel'
	
	# With SQLite3 in-memory (default) using String syntax
	# Caution: This won't persist your jobs!
	EQ.config.sequel = 'sqlite:/' 
	
	# With SQLite3 file using Hash syntax
	EQ.config.sequel = {adapter: 'sqlite', database: 'my_db.sqlite3'}
	
	# With Postgres
	EQ.config.sequel = 'postgres://user:password@host:port/my_db'
	
	# Mysql, Oracle, etc.
	# ...

# LevelDB

Gemfile

	gem 'leveldb-ruby'

Configuration

	EQ.config.queue = 'leveldb'
	EQ.config.leveldb = 'path/to/my/queue.leveldb'

### Logging

EQ uses the logging mechanism of the underlying Celluloid (`Celluloid.logger`) framework. Basically you can just bind it to your application logger or re-configure it (see the Documentation of the `Logger` class from Ruby Standard Library).

**Changing the Logger:**

	# Use the logger of your Rails application.
	Celluloid.logger = Rails.logger
	
	# No logging at all.
	Celluloid.logger = Logger.new('/dev/null')
